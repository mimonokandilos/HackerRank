# (II) PROBLEM & SOLUTION DESCRIPTION
### 1. Python File Description

- QUESTION #1
    DESCRIPTION:
        create class: VendingMachine
        (1) consturctor VendingMachine(num_items, item_price)
        (2)method buy(req_items, money)
        if enough items to serve request and money given is suffiecient  return an integer dentoting the change given back

        if there is enough item but not enough money through excpetion not enough coins

- QUESTION #2
       DESCRIPTION:
        rectangle: constructor= must take two args that denote length of sides
        class= must have an area method returns area of the rectangle
        circle constructor= one arg that denotes the radius of the circle
        class=method returns the area of circle use precise pi constant math.pi
